# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
EDA, or Exploratory Data Analysis, is a way of looking at data to find out what it can tell us. It involves using graphs and visual tools to discover patterns, trends, and interesting facts in the information before doing deeper analysis. It's like taking a first look at the data to see what stands out.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a systematic process that involves examining and understanding a dataset before applying more formal statistical methods. Here are the general steps you might follow in EDA:

**1.Understand the Data:**

-Get a high-level understanding of the dataset.
-Review any available documentation or metadata.
**2. Load the Data**
Import the dataset into your chosen data analysis environment (e.g., Python with Pandas).
**3.Check for Missing Value**
Identify and handle any missing or null values in the dataset.
**4.Descriptive Statistics**
Calculate basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, etc.) to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.
**5.Data Visualization:**
Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore the distribution of individual variables and relationships between them.
**6.Explore Relationships:**
Analyze relationships between variables using correlation matrices, scatter plots, or pair plots.
**7.Handle Outliers:**
Identify and address any outliers that might affect the analysis.
**8.Categorical Variables:**
For categorical variables, explore frequency distributions and create bar charts.
**9.Feature Engineering**
Create new features or modify existing ones to better suit the analysis.
**10.Time-Series Analysis (if applicable):**
If your data involves time, perform time-series analysis to understand trends and patterns.
**11.Understand Data Distributions:**
Assess whether the data follows a particular distribution (normal, skewed, etc.).
**12.Draw Conclusions:**
Summarize findings from the exploratory analysis.
Formulate hypotheses or questions for further analysis.
**13.Iterate:**
EDA is often an iterative process. As you uncover insights, you may need to revisit previous steps or dive deeper into specific aspects of the data.
**14.Document Your Process:**
Keep a record of the steps you've taken, visualizations created, and any decisions made during the EDA process.
